										<p>Here At SCHRPD, fruitful collaboration between constituents and their elected leaders is a critical step toward building democracy, 
                                            but is difficult to realize in countries where political power traditionally has been concentrated in the 
                                            hands of a few. Through technical assistance and training programs aimed at bringing together government 
                                            officials and the community at large, SCHRPD builds democratic linkages between citizensâ€™ groups and 
                                            local government bodies to encourage the equitable distribution of authority and enhance local autonomy. 
                                            SCHRPD also works to increase the effectiveness of civil society in the fight against corruption.  </p>
